Voron Afterburner Mouse Fan Casing

This is a customized fan casing for the voron 2.4. This will allow for using two 5015 blower fans.

This will NOT require reprinting of the fan ducts, simply the two top fan casings (front and back). There might be greater airflow and advantages of replacing the duct in the future (a good example is Badnoobs mode for the 5015). 

Includes a hollowed out back for fan wiring. In the case of this setup for me, I spliced the wires together and therefore it created more of "bunch up" and that can be stored behind.

The reason for the fans being angled to the back is done to avoid any conflicts with the belts and the enclosure panels.

Due to the angle of the fans I believed it to look like a mouse, and thus the name. I added two logos to represent the eyes.
